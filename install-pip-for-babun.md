When developing with Python in on Windows, I use the Babun shell. Here, I describe how to set up a Python environment for use in Babun.

Install easy_setup:

```wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python```

Use easy_setup to install pip:

```easy_install pip```

At this point, you're free to use pip to install Python packages. For example:

```pip install Pillow```
